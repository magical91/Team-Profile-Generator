The "Team Profile Generator" was built with intentions of an application for the user to input data regarding a work environment.
By running the command "node index.js" in the command line the the user will be asked a series of questions and a page will be generated based on user input. First, the user will be prompted about the managers name, employee ID, email, and office number. Second, the user will then be asked if the user would like to add a team member(e.g. Intern, Engineer, or finished adding employees). Lastly after the user runs through all the prompts then finally a page is generated with the user input in the new application.

# Purpose

Create a team profile for a manager with easy readability
